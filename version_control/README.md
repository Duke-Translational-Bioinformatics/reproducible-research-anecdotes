Integrating Version Control into your Research Analysis Routine
-

####Getting started with Git
Git is a fantastic system for tracking changes to code and data over time.  Our [first lesson](/version_cotrol/tracking_changes/) will focus on using the git commandline interface.
To install git, visit the [Git](http://git-scm.com) website and follow the instructions to install the version compatible with your operating system.
We will focus on the git commandline in this session for the following reasons:

+ It is the common denominator for most users on most systems
+ If you work via SSH to remote servers, it can be used without complex X forwarding protocols
+ It can be called programatically by analysis programs written in a variety of languages

####Collaborating with Others
Multiple users can collaborate on the same content using git.  This [lesson](/version_control/collaboration/) will familiarize you with the way the git commandline works with remote
git repositories hosted on a variety of external systems.
