Reproducible Analysis with Docker
===============================
[Docker](http://www.docker.com) is a containerization system that can solve many different problems for many different
domains of IT. For researchers and data scientists, Docker makes possible the creation of a containerized analysis
process appliance that can be run by any researcher on any server hosting the Docker runtime.  Using the triangle of
network accessible data, source code, and Docker images, researchers can now produce a completely reproducible
runtime that processes their specific data to produce their specific results and figures.
