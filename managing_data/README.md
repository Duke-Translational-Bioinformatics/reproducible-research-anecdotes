### Data
Why does this matter? I dare not be too prescriptive about how data should be presented, what format, what standard &c., &c. Science is too diverse and dynamic for us to ever be able to standardize its presentation.

But what I would argue is that if you publish it, it should be centrally accessible (with appropriate governance [PHI, &c]) for our peers and the public to access. If we're OK with reporting a useful conclusion from scientific data, then we should share it too.
